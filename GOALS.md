We are using the Subreddit Hyperlink Network found on the Stanford Dataset Collection at http://snap.stanford.edu/data/soc-RedditHyperlinks.html. The file called “soc-redditHyperlinks-body.tsv” will be used for this project. This network links subreddits to each other based on posts that create hyperlinks from one subreddit to another. Each hyperlink originates from a post in the source community and links to a post in the target community. Each hyperlink has 3 properties: the timestamp, the sentiment of the source post towards the target post, and a vector representing the source post. We are only using the network file that maps hyperlinks in the body of posts. The network is directed, signed, temporal, and attributed.

We have chosen to implement the Depth-First Search(DFS) traversal, using the Floyd Warshall algorithm to find the shortest path between two subreddits. This will allow us to see how two potentially unrelated subreddits are connected with each other. We will also use the PageRank algorithm to rank the subreddits by importance. This allows for the visualization of where you could possibly end up if you were to randomly click around on reddit. We can then use this algorithm to weight each subreddit and learn which subreddits are the most popular or which corners of reddit you could end up on, given that you started at a certain subreddit.
